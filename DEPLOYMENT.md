## ðŸ“‹ Configuration Details

### Environment Variables
- **Production:** Uses `https://ai-competition-2025-production.up.railway.app/api`

- **Node Version:** 18.x Alpine
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Start Command:** `npm start` (serves build folder)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**CORS Issues:**
- Ensure your Railway backend allows requests from your frontend domain
- Add your Railway frontend URL to backend CORS origins

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Local test build
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**API Connection Issues:**
- Verify backend is running: https://ai-competition-2025-production.up.railway.app/api/files
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify environment variables in Railway dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Backend Status

```json
{"success":true,"data":[]}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Update CORS:** Add your Railway frontend URL to backend CORS settings
2. **Domain Setup:** Configure custom domain in Railway dashboard (optional)
