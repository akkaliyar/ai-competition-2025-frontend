# Railway 502 Error - Configuration Fix

## The Problem
502 Bad Gateway means Railway cannot connect to your application. Since even a minimal Node.js server fails, this is a Railway configuration issue.

## Immediate Solutions to Try:

### Solution 1: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click on your `ai-competition-2025-frontend` project
3. Check these tabs:

#### **Deployments Tab:**
- Look for any failed deployments
- Check if the latest deployment shows "Success" or "Failed"
- Click on the latest deployment to see detailed logs

#### **Settings Tab:**
- **Domain Configuration**: Make sure the domain is properly set
- **Port**: Should be automatically detected or set to $PORT
- **Health Check**: Try disabling health checks temporarily

#### **Variables Tab:**
- Check if `PORT` variable exists (Railway usually sets this automatically)
- If missing, add: `PORT` = (leave value empty, Railway will set it)

### Solution 2: Force Redeploy
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy Latest" or trigger a new deployment
4. Wait for it to complete and check logs

### Solution 3: Check Project Settings
1. Go to project "Settings"
2. Under "Environment", check:
   - **Runtime**: Should be Node.js
   - **Build Command**: Should be automatic
   - **Start Command**: `node minimal-server.js`

### Solution 4: Railway CLI Debug
If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway status
railway logs --follow
```

### Solution 5: Create New Railway Project
If nothing works, create a fresh Railway project:
1. Create new project on Railway
2. Connect to the same GitHub repo
3. Deploy again

## Common Railway 502 Causes:
1. **Domain not properly configured**
2. **Project region mismatch**
3. **Resource limits exceeded**
4. **Railway service outage**
5. **GitHub connection issues**

## Test URL After Fixes:
- Main: https://ai-competition-2025-frontend-production.up.railway.app/
- Should show: "Minimal Server Working!" page

## If Still Failing:
Try the nginx static approach by running:
```bash
cp Dockerfile.static Dockerfile
git add . && git commit -m "Switch to nginx" && git push
```
